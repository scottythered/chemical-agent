# chemical-agent
Chemical Agent is a set of (VERY simple) Mutagen-based Python scripts to facilitate bulk audio metadata/tag changes from CSV and TSV files without a GUI program.

To run these scripts, you'll need to install Python (obviously) and [Mutagen](http://mutagen.readthedocs.io/), which you can install from the command line or download from [Git](https://github.com/quodlibet/mutagen).

By default, Chemical Agent will automatically insert artist, track-title, album-title, year, genre and copyright metadata/tags from a data file. For instructions on changing these tags (or adding more), please see the wiki.

Special thanks to [AndrewJDR](https://github.com/AndrewJDR) for all of his help.
